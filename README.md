# Mask Search

[Demo Website](https://mask-search.herokuapp.com/) 

This is the Backend server of mask searching website that provides user with the visualized data of how many mask remain in each county of Taiwan. User can also type the store name or location to search for the stores and check the mask stocks. I hope this may help any people in Taiwan to buy mask and keep the virus away.
